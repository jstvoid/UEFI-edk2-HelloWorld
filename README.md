# UEFI EDK2 Hello World (C)

This repository contains a minimal **UEFI Hello World application** written in C using EDK2.  
It is designed for beginners who want to learn UEFI development from scratch.

## Project Files

- `Uefi.dsc`  → EDK2 DSC file, defines the build configuration.
- `Uefi.inf`  → INF file, lists the source files and module information.
- `Main.c`          → Source code of the Hello World UEFI application.

> Note: This repository only contains the source files. To build and run the application, you need to have **EDK2** set up in your own environment.
